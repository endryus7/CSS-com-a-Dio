    <h1>Layout de multiplas colunas</h1>

    <div class="container">
    Creations emanating between these shifting sands
    The universe is turning in the palm of my hand
    I will make the earthen clay exhuming breath of life
    Behold the culmination of my regrets

    Sentience
    To err is human
    To forgive divine
    A blessing of life
    Cursed to die

    All will rise and fall, their flesh and bone
    My sins and resolve permeate their desires
    I am absolved within their design
    My legacy will live on

    But is it enough to satisfy my legacy?

    Millennia of waiting
    Countless years come to pass
    Separated from Chronos
    This is my domain
    I'm the face of death
    My image, this eternal sin
    Molded from everything
    I hold within

    Sentience
    To err is human
    To forgive divine
    A blessing of life
    Cursed to die

    We play the same keys in different times
    It's in our nature to die

    Powerless to the forces outside of our reach
    I'm nothing but a man within a dream

    All will rise and fall, their flesh and bone
    My sins and resolve permeate their desires

    All will rise and fall, their flesh and bone
    My sins and resolve permeate their desires
    I am absolved within their design
    My legacy will live on

    But is it enough to satisfy my legacy?
    But it's not enough, it's never enough to satisfy my legacy
